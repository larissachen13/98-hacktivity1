# Shrine 

Shrine is a mock e-commerce website that we created in order to learn and become familiar with react native, particularly IOS development within react-native. Shrine is a full-stack project whose stack includes: react-native, redux, and MongoDB. 

## Getting Started

From `hactivity1` folder, run `mongod` to start the MongoDB shell. In separate shell, navigate to `hacktivity1/backend` folder and run `npm run dev` to start the backend. In another shell, run `react-native run-ios` to run the shrine app in the IOS simulator. 

### Capabilities

Right now, the app represents a simple app that supports some CRUD ability. The user can add certain products in the tab labeled `search` to their full list of listings displayed in the tab labeled `favorites`. We used the predefined system icons and their titles for the tab titles and icon. Due to time restraint we couldn't define more appropriate icons. In addition to adding listings, the user can favorite items in the right corner of the listing card.
